= MeTube

A naively simple self-hosted video hosting service

== Introduction

MeTube is a simple video hosting service. It is intended for
single-uploader small throughput use cases such as

- Sharing a funny cat video you just recorded to the family;
- Sharing short gameing moments on social network.

== Features

- Basic HTTP authentication with a preset (in the config file)
  password.
- Easy deployment with only a few dependencies (FFmpeg and sqlite3).
- HTML and CSS are just static files that are easy to modify
- Almost no JavaScript (only in the upload page)
- No transcoding (for now). I don’t like my perfectly encoded video be
  ruined by another encoding. If I implement it later, it will be
  optional.
- Automatic thumbnail generation with ffmpeg.
- Supports the MP4 and WebM containers. The program does not care about
  the streams inside. It is up to the uploader to make sure the
  viewers are able to watch the video on their browsers.

== Planned features

- Playlists
- Deleting videos
- Private videos

== Deployment

=== Dependencies

- A somewhat recent FFmpeg with FFprobe and libwebp support (for
  thumbnail generation). The oldest I’ve tried is 4.4.3.
- sqlite3
